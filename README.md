Employee database analysis
Creating databases from raw data and filtering results through various criteria.

Pelett_hackard, a company with a large employee workforce is facing a problem.
Their workforce is ageing out.  They need to bring in new people to compensate for the number of people retiring.
It is necessary to first identify these individuals, their positions within the company, and their departments.
It is also necessary to identify the people who can move into those soon to be vacant positions from within the company and to point out 
where it is necessary to hire new people.

In deliverable 1, the retiries are sorted and filtered from the employee database containing all employees not just those retiring.
The identified individuals are further sorted by start date, end date, birth date, and department
While some of this information can be used to identify where the holes that need to be filled will be quite a bit of it is nothing more than tracking
data. Showing promotions, and demotions of various individuals.

Deliverable 2, seems to be trying to identify people moving from one department to another internally to fill the upcoming holes and who can therefore mentor new hires
into the new vacated positions.
